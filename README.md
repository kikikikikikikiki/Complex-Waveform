# Complex-Waveform
A pointless imaginary waveforms printer. <br/>
long.wav acts as the pacer for how quickly the waveform is generated, it's just a long sine wave<br/>
You can replace 10simm.wav with anything, as long as it's a wav file<br/>
Example output:<br/>

Outputted files were stitched together with the audio using ffmpeg.<br/>
